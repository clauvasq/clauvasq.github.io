I am working to the molecular blueprints cells use to build tissues that can generate, withstand, and respond to mechanical forces. During my PhD in Adam Martin’s lab at MIT, I found that dynamic regulation of contractile machinery, specifically the molecular motor myosin, is required during cellular constriction and tissue invagination. This experience was my introduction to mechanobiology – an interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding how mechanical cues influence molecular, cellular, and tissue behavior, and motivated my decision to continue my post-doctoral research in this field by joining Alex Dunn’s lab at Stanford. In the first years of my post-doc, I worked to determine the physical mechanisms that drive lumen stability and growth in epithelial tissue – a hallmark of metazoan tissue organization. By drawing on my diverse experience working from the single-molecule level up to the organismal level, I want to establish a successful laboratory that investigates the fundamental rules of how chemical and physical signals orchestrate the arrangements of molecular complexes critical to generate cell- and tissue-level organization essential for the formation of multicellular tissues.
